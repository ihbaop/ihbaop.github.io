## Bad news for her mother

Yes, I shall write it all down, you old cow,
all: the first time, the last time, all the times
in between, and then all the times I should
have liked there to have been. I shall go on
writing it down even out of habit,
till there is nothing left to exorcise.
<br>
You may judge from that the emotional
debt I feel your lovely daughter owes me.
